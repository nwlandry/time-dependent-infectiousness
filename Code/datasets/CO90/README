Partial Project 90 Data

Description: The Project 90 dataset consists of two tab-separated files, edges.tsv
and nodes.tsv, that describe the structure of the Project 90 network and the
individual-level attributes of study participants.

edges.tsv
-----------
Each row indicates an edge in the network, specified by a pair of node ids. Edges 
represent social, sexual, and/or drug affiliation.  Each edge is recorded twice.  
In other words, if there is an edge between 12 and 15, there is also an edge between 15 and 12.

summary statistics
-------------------
Edges: 43,288

nodes.tsv
-----------
Each row corresponds to a study participant. In addition to node id, the following 
attributes are listed for each individual:

Race (1 = Native American; 2 = Black; 3 = Asian/Pacific Islander; 4 = White; 5 = Other)
Gender (0 = Male; 1 = Female)
Sex Worker (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Pimp (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Sex Work Client (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Drug Dealer (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Drug Cook (0 = No; 1 = Yes) 
Thief (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Retired (0 = No; 1 = Yes) 
Housewife (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Disabled (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Unemployed (0 = No; 1 = Yes)
Homeless (0 = No; 1 = Yes)

Missing values are denoted by 'NA'

* Drug cooks are people who manufacture drugs (e.g., methamphetamine and crack) as a main source of income.
